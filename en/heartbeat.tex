Without someone or something acting as the ``heartbeat'' for the group,
energy may dissipate. In the ``Collaborative Lesson Planning'' course
led by Charlie Danoff at P2PU (which I joined twice, and where we first
talked through the ideas about paragogy), Charlie wrote individual
emails to people who were signed up for the course and who had
disappeared, or lurked but didn't participate. This kept some of us
(including me!) making positive contributions. - \emph{Joe Corneli}
