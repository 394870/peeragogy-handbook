In the Jan. 2013 plenary session, as \href{http://IPNE.org}{Independent
Publishers of New England} (IPNE) President Tordis Isselhardt quietly
listened to a presentation about how we created the \emph{Peeragogy
Handbook}. During the Q\&A, he spoke up, wondering if peer-learning
effort in IPNE might be more likely to succeed if the organization's
members ``focused around a specific project.'' As this lightbulb
illuminated the room, those of us attending the plenary session
suggested that IPNE could focus the project by creating an ``Independent
Publishing Handbook.'' (Applause!) In the course of creating the IPNE
Handbook, peer learners would assemble resource repositories, exchange
expertise, and collaboratively edit documents. To provide motivation and
incentive to participate in ``PeerPubU'', members of the association
will earn authorship credit for contributing articles, editor credit for
working on the manuscript, and can spin off their own chapters as
stand-alone, profit-making publications.
