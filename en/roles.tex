This may seem like an obvious one, but educational interactions tend to
have a number of different roles associated with them. Consider that
everything could bifurcate from the ``autodidact'':

1. Autodidact 2. Tutor-Tutee 3. Tutor-Tutee-Parent 5. Tutor-Tutee
\#1-Tutee \#2-Parent-Principal etc., until we have bursars, librarians,
technicians, janitors, editors of peer reviewed research journals,
government policy makers, spin-off industrial ventures and partnerships,
etc., all involved in Education. Even the autodidact may assume
different roles at different points in time - sometimes making a library
run, sometimes constructing a model, sometimes checking a proof. The
decomposition of ``learning'' into different phases or polarities could
be an endless theoretical task. For the moment, we just note that roles
are often present ``by default'' at the start of a learning process, and
that they may change as the process develops.
