Danoff~\href{http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/rolesdivision-labor}{suggests}~that
someone to take on the ``wrapper role'', in other words: do a pre/post
wrap (e.g. weekly), so that new users know where the state of the
project is at any given point in time. ~The
project's~\href{http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/}{main
page}~also serves as a ``wrapper'', and it should be checked from time
to time to make sure that it accurately represents the basic facts about
the project.

Note that the ``wrapper role'' is similar to the integrative function
that is needed for commons-based peer production to work (i.e. according
to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, it is vital to have both (1)
the ability to contribute small pieces; (2) some ``integrative
function'' that stitches those pieces together).
