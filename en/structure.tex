In the introduction to
``Organizing a Learning Context'', we remarked that a ``learning space'' is
\emph{only potentially} less structured than a ``course''. For example,
a library tends to be highly structured, with quiet rooms for reading,
protocols for checking out books, a cataloging and shelving system that
allows people to find what they are looking for, as well as rules that
deter vandalism and theft. (Digital libraries don't need to play by all
the same rules, but are still structured.)

But more structure does not always lead to better learning. In a 2010
Forbes article titled, ``The Classroom in 2020,'' George Kembel
describes a future in which ``Tidy lectures will be supplanted by messy
real-world challenges.'' The Stanford School of Design, (or ``d.school''
-- which Kemble co-founded and currently directs) is already well-known
for its open collaborative spaces, abundant supply of post-it notes and
markers, and improvisational brainstorm activities -- almost the
opposite of traditional lecture-based learning.

One ``unexpected benefit'' of dealing with real-world challenges is that
we can change our approach as we go. This is how it works in peer
learning: peers can decide on different structures not just once (say,
at the beginning of a course), but throughout the duration of their time
together. This way, they are never ``stuck'' with existing structures,
whether they be messy or clean. At least\ldots{} that's the ideal.

In practice, ``bottlenecks'' frequently arise. For example, in a digital
library context, there may be bottlenecks having to do with software
development, organizational resources, community good will, or access to
funding -- and probably all of the above. In a didactic context, it may
be as simple as one person knowing something that others do not.

While we can't eliminate scarcity in one stroke, we can design
activities for peer learning that are ``scarcity aware'' and that help
us move in the direction of adaptive learning structures.

\subsection{Planning Peer Learning Activities}

We begin with two simple questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How do we select an appropriate learning activity?
\item
  How do we go about creating a learning activity if we don't find an
  existing one?
\end{itemize}
``Planning a learning activity'' should mean planning an
\emph{effective} learning activity, and in particular that means
something that people can and will engage with. In short, an appropriate
learning activity may be one that you already do! At the very least,
current activities can provide a ``seed'' for even more effective ones.

But when entering unfamiliar territory, it can be difficult to know
where to begin. And remember the bottlenecks mentioned above? When you
run into difficulty, ask yourself:
\href{http://peeragogy.org/patterns-and-heuristics/}{why is this hard?}
You might try adapting
\href{http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html\#comment-409972596}{Zed
Shaw's task-management trick}, and make a list of limiting factors,
obstacles, etc., then cross off those which you can find a strategy to
deal with (add an annotation as to why). For example, you might decide
to overcome your lack of knowledge in some area by hiring a tutor or
expert consultant, or by putting in the hours learning things the hard
way (Zed would particularly approve of this choice). If you can't find a
strategy to deal with some issue, presumably you can table it, at least
for a while.

Strategic thinking like this works well for one person. What about when
you're planning activities for someone else? Here you have to be
careful: remember, this is peer learning, not traditional ``teaching''
or ``curriculum design''. The first rule of thumb for \emph{peer
learning} is: don't plan activities for others unless you plan to to
take part as a fully engaged participant. Otherwise, in you might be
more interested in the literature on \emph{collaborative learning},
which has often been deployed to good effect within a standard
pedagogical context (see e.g. Bruffee {[}1{]}). In a peer learning
setting, everyone will have something to say about ``what do you need to
do'' and ``why is it hard,'' and everyone is likely to be interested in
everyone else's answer as well as their own.

For example, in a mathematics learning context, you would be likely to
find people\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  solving textbook-style problems;
\item
  finding and sharing new research problems;
\item
  asking questions when something seems too difficult;
\item
  fixing expository material to respond to critique;
\item
  offering critique and review of proposed solutions;
\item
  offering constructive feedback to questions (e.g. hints);
\item
  organizing material into structured collections;
\item
  working on applications to real-world problems;
\item
  doing ``meta'' research activities that analyse ``what works'' for any
  and all of the above.
\end{itemize}
Each one of those activities may be ``hard'' for one reason or another.
As a system the different activities tend to depend on one another. If
you have people working in a ``student role'' but no one who can take on
a ``TA role'', things will be more difficult for the students. As a
(co-)organizer, part of \emph{your} job is to try to make sure all of
the relevant roles are covered by someone (who may in the end wear many
hats). You can further decompose each role into specific concrete
activities. They might be accompanied by instructions that say:
``\emph{How to write a good critique}'' or ``\emph{How to write a proof}''.
They might come in the form of accessible exercises (where ``accessible''
depends on the person). Depending on the features of the learning
context, you may be able to support the written instructions or
exercises with live/in-person feedback (e.g. meta-critique to coach and
guide novice critics, a demonstration, etc.).

\subsection{One scenario: building activities for the Peeragogy
Handbook}

Adding a bunch of activities to the handbook won't solve all of our
usability issues, but more activities would help. We can think about
each article or section from this perspective:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  When looking at this piece of text, what type of knowledge are we (and
  the reader) trying to gain? Technical skills, or abstract skills?
  What's the point?
\item
  What's difficult here? What might be difficult for someone else?
\item
  What learning activity recipes or models might be appropriate? (See
  e.g. {[}2{]}, {[}3{]}.)
\item
  What customizations do we need for this particular application?
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{\emph{}As a quick example: designing a learning activity for the
current page}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{We want to be able to come up with effective learning
  activities, for instance, to accompany a ``how to'' article for peer
  learners}. These activities will extend from from the written word to
  the world of action.
\item
  \emph{It might be difficult for some of us to ``unplug'' from all the
  reading and writing that we're habituated to doing.} But peer learning
  isn't just about the exchange of text: there are lots and lots of ways
  to learn.
\item
  \emph{Like Tom in ``\href{http://peeragogy.org/a-pattern-story/}{A
  pattern story}'', it could be useful to apply an existing set of
  skills to a new problem.}
\item
  \emph{The proposed handbook activity is to simply step away from the
  handbook for a while.} Look for some examples of peer learning in
  everyday life. When you've gained an insight about peer from your own
  experience, come back and create a related activity to accompany
  another handbook page!
