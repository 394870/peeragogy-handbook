The difficulty I am referring to breaks down like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.
\item
  And yet, feedback \emph{can} be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms
  for responding to it in a useful fashion.
\item
  The associated \emph{anti-pattern} is a special case of the
  prototypical Bateson
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double\_bind}{double bind}, ``the
  father who says to his son: go ahead, criticize me, but strongly hints
  that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome'' {[}1{]}, p. 88.
\end{enumerate}
And indeed -- criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just
``noise''. The art of paragogical praxis is to make something useful out
of what would otherwise just be noise\emph{.} (And, note, we have hinted
that for this project,
\href{http://peeragogy.org/how-to-use-this-handbook/}{effective
criticism will be very welcome}!)
