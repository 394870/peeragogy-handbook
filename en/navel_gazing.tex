The difficulty I am referring to breaks down like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.
\item
  And yet, feedback \emph{can} be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms
  for responding to it in a useful fashion.
\item
  The associated \emph{anti-pattern} is a special case of the
  prototypical Bateson
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double\_bind}{double bind}, ``the
  father who says to his son, go ahead and criticize me - with the
  strong hint that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome.''
\end{enumerate}
Indeed -- criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just
``noise''. \emph{The art of paragogical praxis is to make something
useful out of what would otherwise just be noise.}
