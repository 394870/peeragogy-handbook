\subsubsection{How we came to this decision}

These Creative Commons license options were proposed by various members
of the community:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \emph{CC Zero} - public domain; no restrictions for downstream users
\item
  \emph{CC By-SA} - requires downstream users to include attribution and
  to license their work in the same way
\item
  \emph{CC By-SA-NC} - requires downstream users to include attribution,
  to license their work in the same way and disallows any commercial use
  of the content
\end{itemize}

After a brief discussion, no one was in favor of restricting downstream
users, so we decided to go with CC0. We agreed that we would get enough
``credit'' by having our names on
\href{http://peeragogy.org/}{peeragogy.org}. In connection with this
discussion, we agreed that we would work on ways to explicitly build
``reusability'' into the handbook content.
