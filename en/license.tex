\subsubsection{How we came to this decision}

Three Creative Commons licensing options were proposed by
various members of the community.  After a brief
discussion, no one was in favor of restricting downstream
users, so we decided to go with CC0. We agreed that we
would get enough ``credit'' by having our names on
\href{http://peeragogy.org/}{peeragogy.org}. In connection with this
discussion, we agreed that we would work on ways to explicitly build
``reusability'' into the handbook content.
