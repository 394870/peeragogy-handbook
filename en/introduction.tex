\textbf{Welcome to the Peeragogy Handbook!}

The \emph{Peeragogy Handbook} isn't a normal book.  It is an evolving
guide, and it tells a collaboratively written story that \emph{you}
can help write.  It is a living document, and we've released a new
version every year as we improve the material.   

We've built this book collaboratively online.  At any given point in
time the latest version is available on peeragogy.org.  You'll find
comment threads attached to each page.  To talk directly with the
contributors and connect with others who are interested in applying
peeragogy, you can join us in the \emph{Peeragogy in Action}
community \href{https://plus.google.com/communities/107386162349686249470}{on
G+}.

The print edition lets you do some things that the web doesn't.  Get
out a pen or pencil and mark up the text as you read, underline, or
cross things out.  Ask questions and think about how things could be
said better or how the ideas could be made more effective.  We're not
being lazy -- this is what we've been doing ourselves for three years!

To make it easier to dive into the content, we're kicking things off
with a short workbook that contains a concise guide to the who, what,
when, where, and why of peeragogy.  This is followed by a summary of
the following chapters which will help you decide what to read first.
You don't have to read in order.  If you're working through the book
as part of a reading group, which we certainly recommend, you might
want to start near the end with ``How to put Peeragogy into Action''
from the Resources section.

This is a how-to handbook.  As you read, think about applications of
peeragogy, in your life and in the world around you.  For example, how
could a rural village move from no electricity to actively
contributing to peer production projects on the internet?  Or, what
can we do right here at home to make our lives more rewarding?  These
aren't easy questions.  Let's get down to work.
