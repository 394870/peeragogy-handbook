%\textbf{Welcome to the Peeragogy Handbook!}

\emph{Peeragogy} is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and
peer knowledge production.  As pedagogy theoretically articulates the
transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy
describes the way peers produce and utilize knowledge together.  With
OER, wikis, the internet, Free Software and mobile networks, groups of
people can learn, connect and create knowledge together inside and
outside of formal institutions in ways never before possible.  These
tools can facilitate connected learning, and collaborative engagement
but they only work well when combined with practices that work well
for the people involved.

Peeragogy makes use of a novel re-interpretation of four of
Wikipedia's five pillars: \emph{neutral POV}; \emph{free
content}; \emph{respect and civility}; and \emph{no firm rules} --
extending them beyond encyclopedia style creation
(see \pageref{good-faith-collaboration} for details).  The learning
mind-set and new strategies for good faith collaboration that we are
uncovering in the Peeragogy project can be applied in classrooms,
hackerspaces, business meetings, wiki projects and interconnected
collaborations across an entire society.

In this book we will examine the way the values that helped shape
Wikipedia and free software can be applied in other learning contexts.
We draw on our experience as practitioners of ``Mode 2'' knowledge
production (i.e.~in \emph{loosely knit multidisciplinary teams working
together for short periods of time on specific real-world problems}) --
both as co-authors of the book and in a wide variety of other
projects.

As you read, you are invited to look for further applications of
peeragogy in your life and in the world around you.

We begin with a quick walkthrough of the Peeragogy concept, some
warm-up exercises, and a Peeragogy project directory that we think
will be helpful as you get started:
