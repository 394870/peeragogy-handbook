\subsection{What is a \emph{pattern}?}

A \emph{pattern} is anything that happens over and over again. In the
context of peeragogy, we mean repeating things that we \emph{like}, or
that we think are useful for some purpose. Thing that happen a lot but
are not desirable are called \emph{anti-patterns}!

\subsection{What is a \emph{use case}?}

A \emph{use case} describes someone (or something) who uses a given
system or tool to achieve a goal. When writing a use case, it is
presented with a title (which serves as a brief summary), a main actor,
and a success scenario. Additional features can be added, such as
alternate interaction paths leading to a variation on the result.

\subsection{What do you get when you put these together?}

Combine patterns and use cases and you start to get something called a
\emph{pattern language}. See the section on
"\href{http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/patterns-and-heuristics/}{Patterns
and Heuristics}" for one such representation. That page draws on the
relationships between the patterns we've found for organizing peer
learning, and some known problem-solving techniques. See the page
``\href{http://peeragogy.org/researching-peeragogy/}{Researching
peeragogy}'' for additional related discussion.

\subsubsection{Examples}

The above use cases and patterns make the ``story'' abstract -- but how
about some concrete examples of peeragogy in action? Consider:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{http://openhatch.org/}{OpenHatch.org}, ``an open source
  community aiming to help newcomers find their way into free software
  projects.''
\item
  The
  \href{http://campus.ftacademy.org/wiki/index.php/Free\_Technology\_Guild}{Free
  Technology Guild} is a younger project with aspirations similar in
  some ways to those of OpenHatch, but in this case, oriented not just
  to pairing newcomers with mentors, but pairing clients with service
  providers. ``The idea is that we as a group will do useful projects
  for our members or external parties, and on-the-job we mentor and
  learn and get better.'' (Since this is a new project, the
  \href{http://campus.ftacademy.org/community/pg/groups/8500/free-technology-guild-working-group/}{project
  building phase} is itself a nacent example of paragogy.)
\item
  Many more examples on our
  \href{http://peeragogy.org/examples/}{examples} page!

  like most of Alexander's writing. If you want to start out with
  something smaller, there's a pithy essay by Christopher Alexander
