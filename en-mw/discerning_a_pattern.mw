Discerning patterns helps us build our vocabulary or repertoire for peer-learning projects.

<blockquote>''[W]e saw that language use is typically what we have to go on, from an analytical perspective. Generally, if we are not starting with language, we arrive at it soon enough. Language becomes something to pay attention to, in much the same way in which Buddhist practitioners have for centuries spent time watching their breath. — From &quot;''[http://paragogy.net/ParagogicalPraxisPaper Paragogical Praxis]''&quot; by Joe Corneli''</blockquote>
The challenge of discerning a peeragogical pattern revolves around a meta-awareness of language. For example, in building a peer learning profile, a participant might identify an interest such as organic gardening. We notice this is a pattern when it repeats; when organic gardening is frequently listed among interests listed by participants in their introductions. The classic example of a pattern is &quot;a place to wait&quot; ''—''a type of space found in many architectural and urban design projects. Once a pattern is detected, give it a title and write down how the pattern works in a peer learning context. What does this pattern say about the self-selection process of the group? Without jumping to conclusions, consider that an interest in organic gardening, for example, ''might'' indicate the participants are oriented to cooperation, personal health, or environmental activism (emphasis on ''might!'').
