Discerning patterns helps us build our vocabulary or repertoire for peer-learning projects. As a very simple example, in building a peer learning profile, a participant might identify an interest such as organic gardening. We begin to notice that this is a pattern when it repeats -- when organic gardening is frequently listed among the interests listed by participants in their self-introductions. The classic example of an architectural pattern is “''A place to wait''” ''—''a type of space found in many architectural and urban design projects. Once a pattern is detected, give it a title and write down how the pattern works. For example, what does this pattern say about the self-selection process of the group? Without jumping to conclusions, consider that an interest in organic gardening, for example, might indicate the participants are oriented to cooperation, personal health, or environmental activism. How does the pattern relate to other patterns already listed in this catalog?
