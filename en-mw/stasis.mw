Actually, living beings are never ''really'' in stasis. It just sometimes feels that way. Different anti-patterns like [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/anti-patterns-concerns-complaints-and-critiques#comment-2267 Isolation] or [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/anti-patterns-concerns-complaints-and-critiques#comment-1808 Navel-Gazing] have described different aspects of the ''experience'' of feeling like one is in stasis. Typically, what is happening in such a case is that one or more dimensions of life are moving very slowly.

For instance, we were not able to get programming support to improve the first version of the Social Media Classroom, for love or money, since all developer energy was going into the next version. This isn't true stasis, but it can feel frustrating when a specific small feature is desired, but unavailable.

The solution? Don't get hung up on small things, and find the dimensions where movement ''is'' possible. In a sense this is analogous to eating a balanced diet. You probably shouldn't only eat grilled cheese sandwiches, even if you like them a lot. You should go for something different once in a while.

This is also related to the pattern that talks about “[http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/patterns-and-use-cases#comment-2320 Carrying Capacity]”. There is always some dimension on which you can make progress -- it just might not be the same dimension you've recently over-harvested!
