Without someone or something acting as the &quot;heartbeat&quot; for the group, energy may dissipate. In the &quot;Collaborative Lesson Planning&quot; course led by Charlie Danoff at P2PU (which I joined twice, and where we first talked through the ideas about paragogy), Charlie wrote individual emails to people who were signed up for the course and who had disappeared, or lurked but didn't participate. This kept some of us (including me!) making positive contributions. - ''Joe Corneli''
