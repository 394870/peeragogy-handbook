Without someone or something acting as the &quot;heartbeat&quot; for the group, energy may dissipate. In the &quot;Collaborative Lesson Planning&quot; course led by Charlie Danoff at P2PU, Charlie wrote individual emails to people who were signed up for the course and who had disappeared, or lurked but didn't participate. This kept a healthy number of the people in the group to reengage and make positive contributions. In more recent months, Charlotte Pierce has been running weekly meetings by Google Hangout to coordinate work on the ''Peeragogy Handbook''. Not only have we gotten a lot of hands-on editorial work done this way, we've generated a tremendous amount of new material (both text and video footage) that is likely to find its way into future versions of the book.
