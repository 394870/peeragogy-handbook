The difficulty I am referring to breaks down like this:

# Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.
# And yet, feedback ''can'' be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms for responding to it in a useful fashion.
# The associated ''anti-pattern'' is a special case of the prototypical Bateson [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind double bind], &quot;the father who says to his son: go ahead, criticize me, but strongly hints that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome&quot; [1], p. 88.

And indeed -- criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just &quot;noise&quot;. The art of paragogical praxis is to make something useful out of what would otherwise just be noise''.'' (And, note, we have hinted that for this project, [http://peeragogy.org/how-to-use-this-handbook/ effective criticism will be very welcome]!)
