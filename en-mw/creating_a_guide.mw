Meaning-carrying tools, like handbooks or maps, can help people use an idea. In particular, when the idea or system is only &quot;newly discovered&quot;, the associated meanings may not be well understood (indeed they may not have been created). In such a case, the process of creating the guide can go hand-in-hand with figuring out how the system works. Thus, techniques of [http://knowledgecartography.org/ knowledge cartography] and [http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-47/two.html meaning making] are useful for would-be guide creators. Even so, it is worth noting that &quot;the map is not the territory,&quot; and map-making is only one facet of shared human activity. Collaboratively refining a pattern is itself an example of &quot;Creating a Guide&quot; - that is, a pattern description can be thought of as a &quot;micro-map&quot; of a specific activity.
