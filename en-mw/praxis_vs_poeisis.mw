<blockquote>&quot;Praxis, a noble activity, is always one of use, as distinct from poesis which designates fabrication. Only the former, which plays and acts, but does not produce, is noble.&quot; [1] (p. 101)</blockquote>

There is a tension between &quot;making stuff&quot; (''poesis'') and &quot;using stuff&quot; (''praxis''). Peer ''production'', as the name indicates, is about &quot;making stuff.&quot; And making stuff can be fun. But we should also ask ourselves, how much new stuff do we really need? There's not a hard and fast answer to that. We should also consider how much &quot;learning&quot; is really &quot;remix&quot; -- that is, re-use and recycling of other people's ideas and techniques. Understanding and negotiating the tension between reuse and creativity is the key to ''the art of remix'' or &quot;paragogical praxis&quot;!
