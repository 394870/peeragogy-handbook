<blockquote>'''Félix Guattari''': ''Imagine a fenced field in which there are horses wearing adjustable blinkers, and let’s say that the “coefficient of transversality” will be precisely the adjustment of the blinkers. If the horses are completely blind, a certain kind of traumatic encounter will be produced. As soon as the blinkers are opened, one can imagine that the horses will move about in a more harmonious way.'' ([http://nine.fibreculturejournal.org/ Quoted by Andrew Murphy], himself quoting Gary Genosko)

From a design point of view: we should be conscious of interfaces that are &quot;too loud&quot;, and think about how that is compensated for by isolation of various forms. With a too-narrow focus, people end up bumping into each other uncomfortably. However, with an over-wide focus, things are chaotic in other ways (see [http://peeragogy.org/practice/antipatterns/co-learning-messy-with-lurkers/ Co-Learning: Messy with Lurkers]), motivating a narrowing of focus. An effort that isolates itself will not have the occasion to draw on other resources.

This sometimes goes by the name ''Not Invented Here''. But focus is really only a problem when it becomes overfocus, resulting in uncomfortable bumps. When that happens, it seems like a good reason to try to clarify how to engage in a more fruitful manner. Learning how to manage the uncertainty that comes with experimentation is part of what makes the postmodern organization tick!
