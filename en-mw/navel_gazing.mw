The difficulty I am referring to breaks down like this:

# Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.
# And yet, feedback ''can'' be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms for responding to it in a useful fashion.
# The associated ''anti-pattern'' is a special case of the prototypical Bateson [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind double bind], &quot;the father who says to his son, go ahead and criticize me - with the strong hint that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome.&quot;

Indeed -- criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just &quot;noise&quot;. ''The art of paragogical praxis is to make something useful out of what would otherwise just be noise.''
