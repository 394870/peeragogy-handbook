=== Main actor ===

Julian, an enthusiastic convert to the power of peer-learning.

=== Main success scenario ===

# Reflecting on the success of [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/patterns-and-use-cases#comment-1749 Strategy as Learning], Julian notes that other housing associations might benefit from this process. He also notes that as most housing association boards are made up of volunteers like himself, there is a very wide variation in background, knowledge and skills, and therefore not only a need for low cost (free) learning opportunities, but a range of skills available to enable them.
# Julian sets up a peer learning resource on the web, drawing on the experiences in implementing [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/patterns-and-use-cases#comment-1749 Strategy as Learning], and promotes it through industry-specific web forums. He draws attention from an online journalist writing in the housing field who writes a positive article, and as a result a growing number of collaborators come forward.
# Over a period of a year or so, the core team of active users collaborate to create standards and exemplars in relation to different aspects of housing association governance that become a de facto standard in the sector.

=== Thoughts ===

# Obviously a very specific use case that could easily be generalised
# Possible patterns to extract? Seeding Peer Communities, Emergent Standards, Emergent Assessment ???
