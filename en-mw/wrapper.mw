Early on, active peeragogue Charlie Danoff [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/rolesdivision-labor suggested] that someone take on the &quot;wrapper role&quot; â€“ do a weekly pre/post wrap, so that new users would know the status the project is at any given point in time. The project wiki [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/ main page] also serves as a &quot;wrapper&quot;, and in Peeragogy, we check it from time to time to make sure that it accurately represents the basic facts about the project. Note that the &quot;wrapper role&quot; is similar to the integrative function that is needed for commons-based peer production to work (according to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, it is vital to have both 1) the ability to contribute small pieces; 2) some &quot;integrative function&quot; that stitches those pieces together. In Peeragogy, the Weekly Roundup&quot; by Christopher Tillman Neal served to engage and re-engage members. Peeragogues began to eager watched for the weekly reports to see if our teams or our names had been mentioned. When there was a holiday or break, Chris would announce the hiatus, to keep the flow going.
