Early on, active peeragogue Charlie Danoff [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/rolesdivision-labor suggested] that someone take on the &quot;wrapper role&quot; â€“ do a weekly pre/post wrap, so that new users would know the status the project is at any given point in time. The project's [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/ wiki page] also serves as another sort of &quot;wrapper&quot;. We check the public summaries of the project from time to time to make sure that they accurately represent the facts on the ground. Note that in its various forms, the &quot;wrapper role&quot; plays an important integrative function. According to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, for free/open &quot;commons-based&quot; projects to work, it is vital to have both (1) the ability to contribute small pieces; (2) something that stitches those pieces together [1]. In the first year of the Peeragogy project, the &quot;Weekly Roundup&quot; by Christopher Tillman Neal served to engage and re-engage members. Peeragogues began to eager watched for the weekly reports to see if our teams or our names had been mentioned. When there was a holiday or break, Chris would announce the hiatus, to keep the flow going. In the second year of the project, we didn't routinely publish summaries of progress, and instead, we've assumed that interested parties will stay tuned on Google+. Nevertheless, we maintain internal and external summaries, ranging from agendas to press releases to quick-start guides. Regular meetings provide an alternative way to stay up to date: see the Heartbeat pattern.
