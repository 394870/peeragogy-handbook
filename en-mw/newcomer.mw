<blockquote>Unless there is a new person to talk to, a lot of the &quot;education stuff&quot; we do could grow stale. Many of the patterns and use cases for peeragogy assume that there will be an audience or a new generation of learners - hence the drive to create a ''guide''. Note that the ''newcomer'' and the ''wrapper'' may work together to make the project accessible. Even in the absence of actual newcomers, we're often asked to try and look at things with a &quot;beginner's mind.&quot;</blockquote>
Joe Corneli's [http://peeragogy.org/practice/heuristics/heartbeat/ example] evoked my own experience energing the Peeragogy community. As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was kindly welcomed and mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I asked naiive questions and was met with patient answers, guiding questions, and resource links. Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself into a position to contribute to the workflow by editing the live manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity. The concrete act of editing and fact-checking this relatively (to me) unfamiliar topic in physical isolation rapidly raised my understanding of the field. I also returned to the [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy Social Media Classroom] forums to follow up on early offers of editing help from recently uninvolved particpants, resulting in the rekindled interest of several (if not an overwhelming army) new editors. - ''Charlotte Pierce (written while editing this page).''
