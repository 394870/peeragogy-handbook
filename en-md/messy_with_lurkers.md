The second point is similar to the earlier Anti-pattern
“[Misunderstanding Power
(Laws)](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/anti-patterns-concerns-complaints-and-critiques#comment-1854)”.
People have to join in order to try, and when joining is low-cost, and
completion low-benefit, it is not surprising that many people will
"dissipate" as the course progresses. The "messiness" of co-learning is
interesting because it points to a sort of “internal dissipation", as
contributors bring their multiple different backgrounds, interests, and
communication styles to bear.

If we were to describe this situation in traditional subject/object
terms, we would say that peer production has a "low signal to noise
ratio". However, it may be more appropriate (and constructive) to think
of meanings as co-constructed as the process runs, and of messiness (or
meaninglessness) as symptomatic, not of peer production *itself*, but of
deficiencies or infelicities in shared meaning-making and "integrating"
features.
