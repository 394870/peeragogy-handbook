The difficulty I am referring to breaks down like this:

1.  Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.
2.  And yet, feedback *can* be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms for
    responding to it in a useful fashion.
3.  The associated *anti-pattern* is a special case of the prototypical
    Bateson [double bind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind),
    "the father who says to his son: go ahead, criticize me, but
    strongly hints that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome"
    [1], p. 88.

And indeed -- criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just
"noise". The art of paragogical praxis is to make something useful out
of what would otherwise just be noise*.* (And, note, we have hinted that
for this project, [effective criticism will be very
welcome](http://peeragogy.org/how-to-use-this-handbook/ "How to use this handbook")!)
