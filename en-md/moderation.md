[Participation](http://peeragogy.org/organizing-a-learning-context/participation/ "Participation")
in online forums tends to follow a "power law," with vastly unequal
engagement. If you want to counteract this tendency, one possibility
would simply be for the most active participants to step back, and
moderate how much they speak. This is related the the [Carrying
Capacity](http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/patterns-and-heuristics/carrying-capacity/ "Carrying Capacity / Channel Capacity")
pattern and the [Misunderstanding
Power](http://peeragogy.org/practice/antipatterns/misunderstanding-power/ "Misunderstanding power")
anti-pattern: check those out before you proceed. Occupy Wall Street
used a related technique that they called the “[progressive
stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_stack).” There are lots
of other strategies to try.
