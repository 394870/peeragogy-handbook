There is a tension between "making stuff" (*poesis*) and "using stuff"
(*praxis*). Peer *production*, as the name indicates, is about "making
stuff." And making stuff can be fun. But we should also ask ourselves,
how much new stuff do we really need? There's not a hard and fast answer
to that. We should also consider how much "learning" is really "remix"
-- that is, re-use and recycling of other people's ideas and techniques.
Understanding and negotiating the tension between reuse and creativity
is the key to *the art of remix* or "paragogical praxis"!
