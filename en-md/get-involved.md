Hello and welcome!
------------------

The peeragogy project was kicked off around the time of [Howard
Rheingold’s](http://rheingold.com/) January 23, 2012 [Regents
Lecture](http://vimeo.com/35685124) at UC Berkeley on *Social Media and
Peer Learning: From Mediated Pedagogy to Peeragogy*. We have put
together a handbook about peer learning: you're reading it -- maybe on
[our website](peeragogy.org), or in your hammock with the beverage of
your choice and our [print on
demand](http://www.lulu.com/shop/howard-rheingold-and-peeragogyorg-editors/the-peeragogy-handbook/paperback/product-20607425.html)
paperback. Or maybe you grabbed our [free
PDF](http://peeragogy.net/peeragogy-handbook-v1-1.pdf) or some other
remixed version in some other format or flavor from some other place
(which would be
[cool](http://peeragogy.org/resources/license/ "License")!).

But: there’s still [more work to be
done](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/ "Peeragogy.org Roadmap").
We created this page because you might be interested in getting involved
in improving the book or furthering the project in other ways. If so,
we’re happy to have you aboard!

What you do here is largely up to you. Asking questions is actually
extremely helpful: there's almost always someone in our [Google+
community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107386162349686249470)
who would be happy to try to answer them, or refer you to someone else
who can. Or just poke around the public pages on peeragogy.org and leave
a comment or two. Better still, find an area where you feel
knowledgeable -- or are willing to learn -- and start writing (or
filming, dancing, drawing, building, etc.).

The goal we have in mind for our book is for it be a useful guide to
peer learning! To achieve that goal we have in mind multiple
opportunities for peers to contribute:

-   Once we get to know you a little bit we'll be happy to give you a
    login on peeragogy.org and you can start editing and improving this.
-   You can go right ahead and post some links to relevant resources,
    either in comments here, or in the G+ or SMC.
-   Write the text for a new sub-section (this page was once "new" --
    but it's been revised many times by now!).
-   We're particularly interested in case studies about [Peeragogy in
    Action](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-in-action/ "Peeragogy in action")!
-   Organize a team to tackle a larger section or topic.
-   Make a video (like these on our [YouTube
    Channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIQY4ja8e4Br-i9U5KnmyZQ)),
-   Take notes of live meetings, or [grow concept
    maps,](http://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/rid=1K81VLSK7-1RL0RQ4-WZK/Peeragogy%20Cmap.cmap)
-   Organize a newsletter for your group or the whole team,
-   Add general purpose bookmarks to [this Diigo
    group](http://groups.diigo.com/group/peeragogy-handbook ""Peeragogy Handbook" Diigo Group"),
    or post comments and editorial notes about peeragogy.org in [this
    one](http://groups.diigo.com/group/peering-into-peeragogy%20 ""Peering Into Peeragogy" Diigo Group");
    and
-   Discuss peer learning matters and this handbook informally with us
    and with others!

It’s up to you. Instead of worrying too much about [the
rules](http://peeragogy.org/co-working/), join our conversations, take
advantage of the digital memory of the forum to rewind the conversation
all the way to the beginning (if you want to go that far), listen in for
a little bit if you want to, and jump in whenever you're ready. We won’t
know what you're up to until you speak up. You can have a look at the
outstanding tasks and teams that are listed on [this Google
Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2I-z-Pt5NUKk-fpy4jsqxFeXbWS4ao4sIhkxCcRVeI/edit#):
our
[roadmap](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/ "Peeragogy.org Roadmap")
is a useful shared resource too. You can add to these at any time.

We regularly use Google+, Google Hangouts, forums, and email to
communicate asynchronously and pretty much continuously. We also meet
irregularly as a group for synchronous audio-video sessions. Further
details about all these methods of communication can be found below.

In short: here's how it works:
