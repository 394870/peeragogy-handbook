### Introduction

While we could imagine an ideal information processing system that would
(magically) come with all solutions pre-built, a more realistic approach
recognizes that real problem solving always takes time and energy. For
instance, if we "knew", 100%, how to do peeragogy, then we would not
stand to learn very much by writing this handbook. Difficulties and
tensions would be resolved "in advance". The relevant problem solving
approach and associated "learning orientation" will depend on the task
and resources at hand.

### Magical Thinking is the thief of process

Magical thinking of the kind described above robs a context of its
"process" or "motion". The more structure we have in advance, the more
completely we fall back on "traditional" modes of doing things, and the
less we stand to learn. It's also true that traditions and habits can
serve a useful function: they can massively simplify and streamline, and
adopting some healthy habits can free up time and energy, making
learning possible [1]. But it's still going to take work. Time for a few
deep breaths?
