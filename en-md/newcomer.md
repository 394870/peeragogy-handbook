Unless there is a new person to talk to, a lot of the "education stuff"
we do could grow stale. Many of the patterns and use cases for peeragogy
assume that there will be an audience or a new generation of learners -
hence the drive to create a guide. Note that the newcomer and the
[wrapper](http://peeragogy.org/practice/wrapper/ "Wrapper") may work
together to make the project accessible. Even in the absence of actual
newcomers, we often try and look at things with a "beginner's mind." For
example:

> **RÃ©gis Barondeau**: I joined this handbook project late, making me a
> "newcomer". When I started to catch up, I rapidly faced doubts: *Where
> do I start? How can I help? How will I make it, having to read more
> than 700 posts to catch up? What tools are we using ? How do I use
> them?* Etc. Although this project is amazingly interesting, catching
> the train while it already reached high speed can be an extreme sport.
> By taking care of newcomers, we might avoid loosing valuable
> contribuors because they don't know how and where to start, and keep
> our own project on track. **Charlotte Pierce**: Joe was working a lot
> on the book, and I thought "this is interesting hard work, and he
> shouldn't have to do this alone." As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was
> kindly welcomed and mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I
> asked naive questions and was met with patient answers, guiding
> questions, and resource links. Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself
> into a position to contribute to the workflow by editing the live
> manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity.
