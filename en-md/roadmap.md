It is very useful to have an up-to-date public roadmap for the project,
a place where it can be discussed and maintained. This helps
[newcomers](http://peeragogy.org/practice/heuristics/newcomer/ "Newcomer")
see where they can jump in. It also gives a sense of the accomplishments
to date, and any major challenges that lie ahead. Remember, the Roadmap
exists as an artifact with which to share current, but never complete,
understanding of the space. Never stop learning!

### Examples

In the Peeragogy project, once the book's outline became fairly mature,
we could use it as a roadmap, by marking the sections that are
"finished" (at least in draft), marking the sections where editing is
currently taking place, and marking the stubs (possible starting points
for future contributors). After this outline matured into a real [table
of contents](http://peeragogy.org/table-of-contents/), we started to
look in other directions for ways to build on our successes to date, and
started working on a [roadmap for further development of the website and
peeragogy project as a
whole](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/).

### And also

Note that a shared roadmap is very similar to a [Personal Learning
Plan](http://peeragogy.org/to-peeragogy/personal-learning-plan/ "Personal Learning Plan"),
or "paragogical profile". We've made some
[examples](http://campus.ftacademy.org/wiki/index.php/Free_Technology_Guild#Learning_design)
of these as we got started working on the Free Technology Guild.

There is a certain roadmappiness to "presentation of self", and you can
learn to use this well. For instance, when introducing yourself and your
work to other people, you can focus on highlights like these:

-   "What is the message behind what you're doing?"
-   "How do you provide a model others can follow or improve upon?"
-   "How can others get directly involved with your project?"
