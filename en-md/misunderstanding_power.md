Zipf's law (or other formulations of the same thing) govern the [size of
cities](http://www2.econ.uu.nl/users/marrewijk/geography/zipf/index.htm),
and related formulations describe [energy
use](http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/kleibers-law-growth-and-creativity-in-cities/):
roughly speaking, an elephant has a lower metabolism than a mouse and is
more "energy efficient". At that same link, we see the suggestion that
creativity and other social network effects speed up as population
grows! *The anti-pattern*: how many times have we been at a conference
or workshop and heard someone say (or said ourselves) "wouldn't it be
great if this energy could be sustained all year 'round?" Or in a
classroom or peer production setting, wondered why it is that everyone
does not participate equally. "Wouldn't it be great if we could increase
participation?" But participation in a given population is going falls
off according to *some* power law (see Introduction to Power Laws in
[The Uncertainty Principle, Volume II, Issue
3](http://www.theuncertaintyprinciple.danoff.org/v2i3.html)). It would
be a grand illusion to assume that everyone is coming from a similar
place with regard to the various literacies and motivations that are
conducive to participation. Furthermore, a "provisionist" attitude ("If
we change our system we will equalize participation and access") simply
will not work in general. Power laws are an inherent epiphenomenon of
network flow. Certainly, if you can
[moderate](http://peeragogy.org/practice/moderation/ "Moderation") the
way the network is shaped, you can change the "exponent" -- for example,
by helping more people develop relevant literacies. But even so,
"equality" remains a largely abstract notional. Note, as well, that
participation in a given activity tends to fall off over time. Many
people would like to write a hit song or a best selling novel or start a
religion, etc., but few actually do, because it takes sustained effort
over time. See the anti-pattern “[Magical
Thinking](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/magical-thinking/ "Magical thinking")”
for more on this. Our ability to develop new literacies is limited. Much
as Paul Graham wrote about programming languages -- programmers are
typically "satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs" -- so too are people
often "satisfied" with their social environments, because these tend to
dictate the way they think and act in life.
