Unless there is a new person to talk to, a lot of the ``education
stuff'' we do could get kind of stale. Many of the patterns and use
cases for peeragogy assume that there will be an audience or a new
generation of learners - hence things like creating a \emph{guide}. Note
that the \emph{newcomer} and the \emph{wrapper} may work together to
make the project accessible.

Even in the absence of actual newcomers, we're often asked to try and
look at things with a ``beginner's mind.'' Note: Regis has written
\href{http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/suggest-new-discussion-topics\#comment-1796}{practical
advice} for things we can do on behalf of newcomers in this project.
