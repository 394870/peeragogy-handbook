-
-We can see some relationships to the peeragogy patterns we've
-identified, first summed up with a picture here, and in text below (some
-of the nodes in the diagram are clickable, and clicking will take you to
-the page describing that pattern!):
-
-To elaborate in words:
-
-- We \emph{simplify} things for a \textbf{Newcomer}. (In particular,
-this means that we don't expect the newcomer to use a high processing
-level.)
-
-- We \emph{change focus} by using a \textbf{Roadmap} to guide us from
-one step to another. In addition, the project's \textbf{Heartbeat} leads
-us to let go of our focus at one moment, and resume with another point
-of view later.
-
-- We \emph{change description} first of all by having a \textbf{Wrapper}
-who describes the new state of the project. For the Peeragogy project,
-that often meant summing up the high points that we saw over a given
-period of time. It seems possible that with a rich enough\textbf{Pattern
-Language}, the description would itself be made in terms of patterns.
-
-- We \emph{divide} work up not only ``horizontally'' among different
-\textbf{Roles}, but also ``temporally'' by using the \textbf{Roadmap}.
-Someone who is moving ahead with the Roadmap is likely to be ``working
-at the cutting edge''.
-
-- When we \emph{find an analogy}, we are basically \textbf{Creating a
-Guide} of some sort. This can be used as a form of ``exploration'', as
-we look at how one form of engagement may or may not map onto other
-forms of engagement.
-
-- When we \emph{ask for help}, we may avail ourselves of some
-\textbf{Moderation} service that will decide how to deal with our
-request. One simple way to ask for help is \textbf{Polling for Ideas}.
-Obviously once we start to get help, we're working in a regime of
-``collaborative effort''.
-
-- If you \emph{know the answer}, then you may be able to reuse it (which
-is the basic idea described in \textbf{Praxis vs Poesis}, though the
-title is a little bit obscure). Someone who knows the answer and who is
-good at self-explanation may also have a good idea about how to get from
-the current state to the goal state; alternatively, this may be broken
-down into steps in some sub-Roadmap, and moving from step to step would
-then illustrate ``progressive problem solving''.
-
-- It is important to \emph{give it a rest} so as not to over-exhaust
-oneself, busting one's own \textbf{Carrying Capacity}, or,
-alternatively, overwhelming the group.
-
-- It seems that one of the things that \emph{experts do} is
-\textbf{Discerning a Pattern}. This allows them to simplify their
-processing.
-
-- Finally, again, if we \emph{know why it is hard}, then we may be able
-to\textbf{Create a Guide} that will help get around, or at least better
-cope with, the difficulty.
