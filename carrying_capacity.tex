\emph{The carrying capacity of a biological species in an environment is
the maximum population size of the species that the environment can
sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water and other
necessities available in the environment}. -- Wikipedia's article on

\emph{If overstimulation at the sensory level increases the distortion
with which we perceive reality, cognitive overstimulation interferes
with our ability to ``think.'' While some human responses to novelty are
involuntary, others are preceded by conscious thought, and this depends
upon our ability to absorb, manipulate, evaluate and retain
information.} -- ``Future Shock'', by Alvin Toffler

I have been concerned that I might over-contribute and ``drown out''
other voices here. When I feel like that, I think I should take a step
back. That's double true if I start to feel the symptoms of
``burn-out''. However, I categorize this as a ``pattern'', not an
antipattern. It is good to know your limits, and the limits of the
community you work with. Find the level of engagement that works. Lead
by example -- but make sure it's someplace people actually want to go!
